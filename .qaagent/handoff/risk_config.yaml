# Risk scoring config — tuned for black-box UI/E2E testing
version: 1

scoring:
  weights:
    # Security lower — no source access, can only test auth flow
    security: 1.5
    # Coverage highest — primary concern for test framework
    coverage: 3.0
    # Churn N/A — testing a deployed app, not the source
    churn: 0.0
    # Complexity moderate — UI complexity affects test reliability
    complexity: 1.0
    # API exposure N/A — no direct API testing
    api_exposure: 0.0
    # A11y important — Kanban boards have accessibility concerns
    a11y: 2.0
    # Performance relevant — SPA load times, navigation speed
