# QA Plan: Kanban Board Application

**Target:** https://animated-gingersnap-8cf7f2.netlify.app/
**Framework:** Playwright + TypeScript (data-driven)
**Generated:** 2026-02-05
**Generated by:** qaagent methodology

## 1. Application Under Test

A Kanban-style project management board built with React + TypeScript (Vite). Features:

- **Authentication:** Username/password login (admin/password123)
- **3 Projects:** Web Application, Mobile Application, Marketing Campaign
- **4 Kanban Columns:** To Do, In Progress, Review, Done
- **Task Cards:** Title, description, colored tags, assignee, date
- **Sidebar Navigation:** Project switching with subtitle descriptions
- **Logout:** Top-right logout button

## 2. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Category | Description |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Auth bypass | P0 | Security | No rate limiting visible; credentials are simple |
| Data integrity | P1 | Reliability | Tasks must appear in correct columns with correct tags |
| Cross-browser rendering | P1 | Quality | Kanban layout uses CSS grid/flex — browser differences possible |
| Navigation state | P2 | Reliability | Switching projects could leak state between boards |
| SPA routing | P2 | Reliability | Client-side routing may break on direct URL access |
| Tag color mapping | P3 | Quality | Tag colors (blue=Feature, red=Bug, etc.) must be consistent |
| Responsive layout | P3 | Quality | Sidebar + 4 columns may overflow on small viewports |
| Accessibility | P2 | A11y | Kanban boards are notoriously poor for screen readers |

## 3. Critical User Journeys (CUJs)

| ID | Journey | Coverage Target | Status |
|----|---------|-----------------|--------|
| auth_login | User logs in with valid credentials | 90% | Covered (auth.setup.ts) |
| auth_negative | Invalid login attempts handled | 70% | Covered (auth-negative.spec.ts) |
| project_navigation | User navigates between projects | 80% | Covered (navigation.spec.ts) |
| board_structure | Kanban board renders correctly | 80% | Covered (board-structure.spec.ts) |
| task_verification_web | Web Application tasks verified | 100% | Covered (TC001-TC003, TC007-TC008) |
| task_verification_mobile | Mobile Application tasks verified | 100% | Covered (TC004-TC006) |
| task_verification_marketing | Marketing Campaign tasks verified | 100% | Covered (TC009-TC011) |

## 4. Coverage Matrix

### Task Coverage by Project x Column

| Project | To Do | In Progress | Review | Done |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|------|
| Web Application | TC001, TC002 | TC003 | TC007 | TC008 |
| Mobile Application | TC004 | TC005 | (empty) | TC006 |
| Marketing Campaign | TC009 | TC010 | TC011 | (empty) |

**Note:** An equivalent Python Behave (BDD) implementation exists in `python-behave/` with matching coverage across all 25 scenarios. See [`python-behave/docs/README.md`](../python-behave/docs/README.md).

### Test Suite Breakdown

| Suite | Tests | Type |
|-------|-------|------|
| auth.setup.ts | 1 | Setup (positive auth) |
| auth-negative.spec.ts | 3 | Negative auth scenarios |
| board-structure.spec.ts | 7 | Board structure + sidebar |
| navigation.spec.ts | 3 | Cross-project navigation |
| task-verification.spec.ts | 11 | Data-driven task verification |
| **Total** | **25** | |

## 5. Complete Task Inventory

### Web Application (5 tasks)

| Task | Column | Tags | Test ID |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| Implement user authentication | To Do | Feature, High Priority | TC001 |
| Fix navigation bug | To Do | Bug | TC002 |
| Design system updates | In Progress | Design | TC003 |
| API integration | Review | Feature, High Priority | TC007 |
| Update documentation | Done | Feature | TC008 |

### Mobile Application (3 tasks)

| Task | Column | Tags | Test ID |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| Push notification system | To Do | Feature | TC004 |
| Offline mode | In Progress | Feature, High Priority | TC005 |
| App icon design | Done | Design | TC006 |

### Marketing Campaign (3 tasks)

| Task | Column | Tags | Test ID |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| Social media calendar | To Do | Feature | TC009 |
| Email campaign | In Progress | Design, High Priority | TC010 |
| Landing page copy | Review | Design | TC011 |

## 6. Test Pyramid

```
         /  E2E (25 tests)  \         ← Current focus
        / ────────────────── \
       /  Integration (0)     \       ← N/A (no API access)
      / ────────────────────── \
     /    Unit Tests (0)        \     ← N/A (no source access)
    /────────────────────────────\
```

This is a **black-box E2E testing** engagement. Without source code or API access, all testing is at the E2E layer through the browser. The test pyramid is inverted by necessity — this is expected for a deployed SPA with no backend visibility.

## 7. Recommended Future Expansion

### High Priority
- [ ] **Cross-browser testing** — Run suite against Firefox and WebKit (config already supports it)
- [ ] **Accessibility audit** — Use axe-core integration to check WCAG compliance on each board
- [ ] **Session persistence** — Verify auth state survives page refresh
- [ ] **Direct URL navigation** — Test navigating directly to app URL when not authenticated

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Responsive layout** — Test on mobile viewport sizes (sidebar behavior, column stacking)
- [ ] **Logout flow** — Verify logout button redirects to login and clears session
- [ ] **Tag color verification** — Assert tag background colors match expected scheme
- [ ] **Card detail content** — Verify descriptions, assignees, and dates on each card

### Lower Priority
- [ ] **Performance baseline** — Measure page load times and navigation latency
- [ ] **Empty state handling** — Verify behavior when a column has 0 tasks
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation** — Test tab order through sidebar, columns, and cards
- [ ] **Visual regression** — Screenshot comparisons for layout stability

## 8. qaagent Integration

This project includes qaagent configuration files for integration with the QA Agent framework:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.qaagent.yaml` | Project configuration for qaagent CLI |
| `handoff/cuj.yaml` | Critical User Journey definitions |
| `handoff/risk_config.yaml` | Risk scoring weights (tuned for UI testing) |

To analyze this project with qaagent:
```bash
qaagent analyze collectors --target /path/to/demoapp
qaagent report --sources reports/ --out reports/findings.md
```

---

## 9. Execution

```bash
# Run all tests (25 tests, ~10s)
npx playwright test --project=setup --project=no-auth --project=chromium --grep-invert "DEMO FAIL"

# Run only task verification (11 data-driven tests)
npx playwright test task-verification --project=setup --project=chromium

# Run cross-browser
npx playwright test --project=setup --project=no-auth --project=chromium --project=firefox --project=webkit --grep-invert "DEMO FAIL"

# View report
npm run report
```
